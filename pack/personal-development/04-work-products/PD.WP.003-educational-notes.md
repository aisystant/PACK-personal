# [PD.WP.003] Educational Notes

---

## Definition

**Educational Notes** are notes created during Systematic Slow Reading or Thinking by Speaking when cognitive resonance occurs — the moment when new information collides with existing mental models. Unlike fleeting notes (spontaneous ideas during the day), educational notes emerge specifically from engagement with study materials and capture the agent's thinking at the point of collision.

Educational notes are NOT:
- Highlights or bookmarks (those mark text, not thought)
- Summaries of what was read (those reproduce source, not generate thought)
- Fleeting notes (those arise spontaneously, not from study)
- Drafts (educational notes are raw input for the draft creation stage)

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Thought capture** | Records the moment of cognitive resonance before it fades |
| **Pipeline input** | Feeds the creative pipeline (notes → drafts → publications) |
| **Neural pathway evidence** | Each note represents a new connection being formed in the agent's neural network |
| **Knowledge base seed** | Over time, accumulates into personal knowledge base in exocortex |

## Produced By

| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [PD.METHOD.003 Systematic Slow Reading](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.003-systematic-slow-reading.md) | Primary source — notes created during reading pauses |
| [PD.METHOD.005 Thinking by Speaking](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.005-thinking-by-speaking.md) | Secondary source — notes written after verbal articulation |

---

## Consumed By

| Consumer | How Used |
|----------|----------|
| [PD.METHOD.004 Thinking in Writing](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.004-thinking-in-writing.md) | As raw material for draft sorting and development |
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Reviews notes to identify patterns and priority topics |

## Existence Criteria

| Criterion | Test |
|-----------|------|
| **Written artifact** | Can be pointed to, opened, and read by another person |
| **Originated from study** | Created during engagement with pre-selected study materials, not spontaneously |
| **Contains agent's thought** | Captures the agent's own thinking, not a copy of the source text |
| **Timestamped** | Recorded close to the moment of cognitive resonance |
| **Linked to source** | References the material that triggered the resonance |

**Existence check**: Can another person read this note and understand what thought the agent had in response to what material?

---

## Quality Criteria

| Criterion | Description | How to Verify |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Concept engagement** | Note engages with specific concepts, not vague impressions | Contains named concepts or principles |
| **Resonance visible** | Clear what existing model was challenged or extended | Shows collision between new and old |
| **Actionable** | Can be developed into a draft during note sorting | Contains enough substance for elaboration |
| **Timely** | Created during or immediately after reading/speaking | Timestamp within session window |

---

## Typical Form

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Inline note** | Written alongside reading in split-screen setup |
| **Margin annotation** | Digital annotation in reading application |
| **Separate note** | Created in note-taking app with link to source |
| **Voice memo transcript** | Recorded during thinking by speaking, then transcribed |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Problematic |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Copy-paste from source | No cognitive resonance — just reproduction |
| "Interesting" without elaboration | No thought captured — just emotional reaction |
| Summary of chapter | Reproduces source structure, not agent's thinking |
| Notes without source reference | Cannot trace what triggered the resonance |
| Notes accumulated but never sorted | Pipeline blocked at stage 1; notes lose value over time |
