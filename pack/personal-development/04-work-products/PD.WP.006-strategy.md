# [PD.WP.006] Strategy (Document)

---

## Definition

**Strategy** (as a document) is a written description of hypotheses about methods, projects, and resource allocation for resolving the agent's dissatisfactions and achieving goals. The strategy document is deliberately treated as a rapidly obsoleting artifact — it may become outdated within days, which is why the strategizing process (PD.METHOD.008) must be continuous.

A strategy document is NOT:
- A permanent plan (it is a hypothesis, not a commitment)
- A to-do list (which contains tasks, not strategic choices)
- A vision statement (which is aspirational, not actionable)
- The strategizing method itself (the document is a snapshot; the method is the process)

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Hypothesis externalization** | Makes strategic choices inspectable and revisable |
| **Decision record** | Documents why certain projects were chosen over others |
| **Immune system** | "Either you strategize, or others plan you" — explicit strategy protects agent's attention |
| **Communication tool** | Can be shared with mentors or peers for feedback |

## Existence Criteria

| Criterion | Test |
|-----------|------|
| **Written artifact** | Can be pointed to, opened, and read |
| **Contains hypotheses** | States what methods/projects will resolve which dissatisfactions |
| **Contains reasoning** | Explains why these choices were made (selection criteria) |
| **Dated** | Has creation/update date for obsolescence tracking |
| **Actionable** | Leads to specific priority projects |

**Existence check**: Can another person read this document and understand what the agent is pursuing and why?

---

## Quality Criteria

| Criterion | Description | How to Verify |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Freshness** | Updated within the last week | Check date |
| **Hypothesis framing** | Choices treated as testable hypotheses, not commitments | Language includes "if...then", "testing" |
| **Selection criteria explicit** | Criteria for choosing projects are documented | Criteria section present |
| **Pivot readiness** | Contains conditions under which strategy would change | "Would change if..." present |
| **Linked to dissatisfactions** | Every strategic choice traces back to a dissatisfaction | Traceability visible |

---

## Typical Form

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Exocortex post** | Draft or published post outlining current priorities |
| **Structured document** | Sections: dissatisfactions, projects, methods, criteria, timeline |
| **Table** | Columns: project, method, dissatisfaction addressed, hours budget, status |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Problematic |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Strategy as permanent plan | Resists change; becomes obsolete and irrelevant |
| Strategy in the head | Not inspectable; loses externalization benefit |
| Strategy without selection criteria | Arbitrary choices without reasoned basis |
| Strategy without dissatisfaction linkage | Projects may not address actual problems |
| Never reviewed | Loses relevance within days |
