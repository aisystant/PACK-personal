# [PD.WP.004] Draft (Заготовка)

---

## Definition

**Draft** (заготовка) is an unfinished text created through Thinking in Writing, written primarily for the agent and their peers. It is the main visible work product of the creative pipeline's stage 4. A draft is NOT a public article — it does not require professional writing skills (storytelling, infostyle, technical writing). It requires only that the agent has engaged with concepts through writing.

A draft is NOT:
- A public article or post (those require additional applied practices beyond thinking in writing)
- A collection of notes (those are raw material; a draft is a connected text)
- A journal entry (which records events; a draft explores concepts and their connections)
- A finished product (it is intentionally unfinished and may be rewritten)

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Thought crystallization** | Transforms scattered notes into connected reasoning |
| **Hypothesis testing** | When shared with peers, tests whether the agent's understanding is coherent |
| **Skin in the game** | Publication (even among peers) creates accountability and quality incentive |
| **Knowledge base entry** | Becomes part of personal knowledge base in exocortex |

## Produced By

| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [PD.METHOD.004 Thinking in Writing](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.004-thinking-in-writing.md) | Primary method — drafts emerge from sorted notes through writing |

---

## Consumed By

| Consumer | How Used |
|----------|----------|
| Peers / community | Read and provide feedback; test hypotheses |
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Revisits and rewrites drafts as understanding deepens |
| Professional writing practices (future) | Raw material for public articles, posts, books |

---

## Existence Criteria

| Criterion | Test |
|-----------|------|
| **Written text** | Can be read by another person without verbal explanation |
| **Connected reasoning** | Contains linked ideas, not isolated bullet points |
| **Based on notes** | Created from accumulated notes, not from scratch |
| **Concept engagement** | Engages with specific concepts, principles, or their connections |
| **Shared** | Published at minimum among peers (not kept in private) |

**Existence check**: Can a peer read this and understand what conceptual claim the agent is making?

---

## Quality Criteria

| Criterion | Description | How to Verify |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Concept density** | Engages with named concepts and their relationships | Concepts are identifiable in the text |
| **Original thought** | Contains agent's own reasoning, not just source paraphrase | Can distinguish agent's additions from source material |
| **Rewritability** | Agent treats it as improvable, not final | Agent has rewritten or plans to rewrite |
| **Peer comprehensibility** | Peers can understand the main claim | Feedback received from at least one reader |

---

## Typical Form

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Blog post (draft)** | 5-paragraph structure: context, concept, connection, application, question |
| **Exocortex entry** | Note in personal knowledge base with links to related entries |
| **Chat message** | Shared in community channel for discussion |
| **Voice-to-text** | Dictated and transcribed, then minimally edited |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Problematic |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Writing from scratch | Bypasses note accumulation; leads to burnout and shallow content |
| Expecting perfection | Fear of sharing prevents the skin-in-the-game effect |
| Keeping private | No hypothesis testing; no feedback loop; motivation decays |
| Opinion without concepts | Produces personal blog, not knowledge base |
| Never rewriting | Treats first version as final; prevents growth |
