# [PD.WP.005] Dissatisfaction List

---

## Definition

**Dissatisfaction List** is a structured inventory of the agent's dissatisfactions — psychic states arising in response to gaps between the current situation and the desired outcome. Each entry captures the problem (obstacle or opportunity), the associated dissatisfaction (psychic state linked to needs), and the emotions/feelings that express it. The list is the primary input for strategizing sessions.

A dissatisfaction list is NOT:
- A to-do list (which contains tasks, not dissatisfactions)
- A mood diary (which records emotional states without problem analysis)
- A complaint list (which expresses frustration without structured analysis)
- A goal list (goals emerge from processing dissatisfactions, not the reverse)

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Explicitation** | Transforms intuitive unease into formal descriptions that can be analyzed |
| **Strategizing input** | Provides the primary data for selecting priority projects |
| **Anxiety reduction** | Writing down dissatisfactions reduces unstructured worry |
| **Pattern detection** | Over time, reveals recurring themes and underlying needs |

## Produced By

| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [PD.METHOD.008 Strategizing](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.008-strategizing.md) | Created and updated during weekly strategizing sessions |
| [PD.METHOD.004 Thinking in Writing](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.004-thinking-in-writing.md) | Fleeting notes about negative feelings feed into the list |

---

## Consumed By

| Consumer | How Used |
|----------|----------|
| [PD.METHOD.008 Strategizing](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.008-strategizing.md) | Reviewed weekly to update priorities and select projects |
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Monitors own state and progress in resolving dissatisfactions |

---

## Existence Criteria

| Criterion | Test |
|-----------|------|
| **Written artifact** | Can be opened and inspected by another person |
| **Structured entries** | Each entry has: problem, dissatisfaction, emotion/feeling |
| **Linked to needs** | Entries connected to underlying needs (safety, respect, self-realization, etc.) |
| **Regularly updated** | Updated at least weekly during strategizing sessions |
| **Non-empty** | Contains at least one entry (zero dissatisfactions suggests incomplete reflection) |

**Existence check**: Can another person read this list and understand what problems the agent faces and how they feel about them?

---

## Quality Criteria

| Criterion | Description | How to Verify |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Completeness** | Covers all significant life areas, not just one domain | Multiple areas represented |
| **Specificity** | Problems described concretely, not vaguely | Each entry has observable problem description |
| **Need linkage** | Dissatisfaction linked to underlying need | "Because I need X" is explicit |
| **Emotion differentiation** | Distinguishes emotions (minutes) from feelings (weeks-years) | Labels are specific, not generic |
| **Actionability** | Each entry can potentially lead to a project | Not purely philosophical complaints |

---

## Typical Form

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Table** | Columns: problem, dissatisfaction, emotion/feeling, need, potential project |
| **Spreadsheet** | Structured data with sortable/filterable columns |
| **Exocortex entry** | Note in personal knowledge base with tags and links |

### Minimal Structure

```
| # | Problem | Dissatisfaction | Emotion/Feeling | Need | Potential Project |
|---|---------|-----------------|-----------------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | [observable gap] | [psychic state] | [specific emotion] | [Maslow level] | [possible action] |
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Problematic |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Vague entries | "Something is wrong" — not actionable, not analyzable |
| Only negative emotions | Missing opportunities (positive dissatisfactions: "I could be doing X") |
| Never updated | Stale list does not reflect current state |
| Too many entries without prioritization | Overwhelm without direction |
| Kept in head | Loses explicitation benefit and anxiety-reduction effect |
