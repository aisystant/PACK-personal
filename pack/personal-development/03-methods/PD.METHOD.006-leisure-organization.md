# [PD.METHOD.006] Leisure Organization

---

## Definition

**Leisure Organization** is a method of systematic selection, planning, and execution of leisure practices across all time horizons (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years). Leisure is defined as activity where the primary benefit occurs during the process itself (positive impressions), as opposed to work where the primary benefit is the result (work product).

Leisure organization is NOT:
- Leisure practice itself (swimming, reading fiction, traveling — those are practices being organized)
- Passive rest (TV, social media — those produce weak impressions and poor recovery)
- Spontaneous "doing nothing" (that is absence of method, not the method)
- Work disguised as leisure (if result matters more than process, it is work)

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Quality of life** | Systematic generation of strong positive impressions and joy |
| **Recovery** | Physical and mental restoration enabling sustained productive work (6-9 hours/day) |
| **Role expansion** | Increasing the number of roles performed makes life richer |
| **Burnout prevention** | Echeloned defense against fatigue, exhaustion, and depression |

---

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required? |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Time budget | Available time across different horizons | Yes |
| Financial resources | Budget for leisure practices | Yes |
| Physical capabilities | Health constraints and possibilities | Yes |
| Available roles and social environment | People and communities for social leisure | No |
| Sleep and daily routine data | Foundation for scheduling leisure | Yes |

---

## Outputs (Work Products)

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Leisure practices table | Documented system of practices organized by time horizon |
| Daily routine | Structured schedule with echeloned leisure at all time scales |
| Strong positive impressions | The primary product — memories of full life |
| Restored body and mind | Readiness for productive work |

## Roles Involved

| Role | Responsibility in This Method |
|------|------------------------------|
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Selects, plans, and controls leisure practices |

## Related Methods

| Method | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| [PD.METHOD.001 Time Accounting](./PD.METHOD.001-time-accounting.md) | Provides data — tracks time invested in leisure practices |
| [PD.METHOD.008 Strategizing](./PD.METHOD.008-strategizing.md) | Determines resource allocation — leisure budgets set during strategizing |
| [PD.METHOD.007 Environment Formation](./PD.METHOD.007-environment-formation.md) | Creates conditions — leisure happens within formed environment |

## Key Distinctions

| Distinction | Link | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| Leisure vs. Work | [D.020](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d020-leisure-vs-work) | In leisure, attention is on process; in work, on result. Confusing them corrupts both |
| Leisure practice vs. Leisure organization | — | Practice is the activity itself; organization is managing the system of practices |

---

## Echeloned Defense Principle

Leisure must be present at all time scales — no horizon should be empty:

| Horizon | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Minutes | Micro-breaks, breathing exercises |
| Hours | Pomodoro breaks, walks |
| Days | Evening leisure practices, exercise |
| Weeks | Weekend activities, social events |
| Months | Vacations, retreats |
| Years | Major life experiences ("at least once" list) |

---

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Passive "rest" | TV and social media produce weak impressions and poor mental recovery |
| No routine | Without schedule, leisure is spontaneous and unreliable; no cumulative effect |
| Late fatigue detection | Fatigue sensor triggers too late; systematic scheduling needed as prevention |
| Sleep and routine neglect | Without sleep hygiene and daily routine, other practices are ineffective |
| One-sided life | All work (burnout) or all leisure (no achievement); balance required |
| Bad habits | Smoking, alcohol disrupt rhythm and steal time-attention |
| Missing time horizons | Leisure present at some horizons but absent at others |

---

## SoTA Status

**Status**: `current`

**Basis**: The echeloned defense model and leisure-as-process distinction draw from Aisystant methodology. Sleep quality as integral indicator is supported by sleep science research.

**Revision criterion**: Status would change if evidence shows that unstructured spontaneous leisure produces equivalent recovery and life satisfaction outcomes.
