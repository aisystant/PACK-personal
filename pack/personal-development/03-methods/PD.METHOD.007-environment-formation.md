# [PD.METHOD.007] Environment Formation

---

## Definition

**Environment Formation** is a method of deliberate long-term development of the physical and social environment with which a person interacts. The environment includes physical objects (workspace, housing, clothing, urban space) and social connections (family, colleagues, communities, mentors, content creators). The method treats environment not as a given constraint but as a system that can be consciously developed from its current state.

Environment formation is NOT:
- Creating environment from scratch (impossible — one always starts from current state)
- Interior design alone (that is an applied skill within the broader method)
- Social networking for its own sake (the goal is developmental environment, not contact accumulation)
- Complete isolation from negative influences (impossible; the goal is gradual improvement)

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Enabling conditions** | Provides continuous, low-cost support from environment for achieving goals |
| **Worldview formation** | Environment is the primary source of concepts, cultural memes, and mental models |
| **Role activation** | Physical attributes and social setting help agent enter the required role |
| **Attention economy** | Well-formed environment frees attention and time for investment in self-development |
| **Positive impressions** | Continuous interaction with developed environment produces wellbeing |

---

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required? |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Current environment state | Assessment of physical and social environment | Yes |
| Dissatisfaction analysis | Which elements of environment need improvement | Yes |
| Understanding of environment characteristics | Functionality, aesthetics, developmental potential, motivational capacity | Yes |
| Time and financial resources | Investment budget for environment development | Yes |

---

## Outputs (Work Products)

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Functional environment | Physical space optimized for task execution without obstacles |
| Aesthetic environment | Space that produces positive impressions and beauty |
| Developmental environment | Environment that promotes learning and talent development |
| Motivational environment | Social setting that pushes agent forward |
| Environment development projects | Documented plans for improving specific environment elements |

## Roles Involved

| Role | Responsibility in This Method |
|------|------------------------------|
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Assesses, plans, and executes environment improvements |

## Related Methods

| Method | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| [PD.METHOD.008 Strategizing](./PD.METHOD.008-strategizing.md) | Determines priorities — environment projects may emerge from strategizing |
| [PD.METHOD.003 Systematic Slow Reading](./PD.METHOD.003-systematic-slow-reading.md) | Depends on — requires comfortable workspace with large screen |
| [PD.METHOD.006 Leisure Organization](./PD.METHOD.006-leisure-organization.md) | Depends on — leisure happens within formed environment |

## Key Distinctions

| Distinction | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| Physical environment vs. Social environment | Different objects of influence, both equally important; division is conventional as they intertwine |
| Forming vs. Creating from scratch | Personal environment is developed from current state, not built anew |
| Fundamental knowledge vs. Applied practice | Method includes both understanding (what, for whom, why) and applied skills (design, curation) |
| Autonomy vs. Openness | Agent must be simultaneously autonomous (not letting environment capture attention) and open (receiving its influence) |

---

## System Levels

Environment formation operates at multiple system levels:

| Level | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Personal | Workspace, clothing, personal devices |
| Family | Home, shared spaces, family routines |
| Team | Office, collaboration tools, team culture |
| Community | Professional communities, learning groups |
| City/Society | Urban environment, public spaces |

---

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Environment as given | Treating environment as unchangeable constraint instead of developable system |
| Neglecting one component | Working only on physical or only on social environment |
| Stagnant environment | Drawing information from outdated sources, thinking in old memes |
| Perfectionism about current state | Exhausting attention on non-ideal aspects instead of accepting and improving gradually |
| No systematic maintenance | Environment changes on its own if not maintained; relationships require scheduled communication |
| Missing applied skills | Not learning specific skills needed (design, content curation, community building) |
| No investment | Not allocating time and resources for environment development |

---

## SoTA Status

**Status**: `current`

**Basis**: The four-characteristic model of environment (functionality, aesthetics, developmental potential, motivation) and system-level approach draw from Aisystant methodology. Environmental influence on cognition is supported by research on situated cognition and environmental psychology.

**Revision criterion**: Status would change if evidence shows environment has no measurable effect on agent productivity and development, or if virtual environments fully substitute physical ones.
