# [PD.METHOD.003] Systematic Slow Reading

---

## Definition

**Systematic Slow Reading** is a method of daily planned consumption of pre-selected quality information with deliberate pauses for creating educational notes. "Slow" refers not to reading speed but to the practice of stopping to record thoughts that arise when new information encounters existing mental models (cognitive resonance).

Systematic slow reading is NOT:
- Speed reading (a different practice for different purposes)
- Casual browsing or entertainment consumption
- Reading without note-taking (that is just reading)
- A standalone practice (operates in tandem with Thinking in Writing)

---

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Planned information intake** | Guarantees daily receipt of quality information selected in advance, not dictated by environment |
| **Cognitive resonance** | Creates collisions between new knowledge and existing mental models, producing insights |
| **Creative pipeline initiation** | Feeds the first stage of the creative pipeline (notes → drafts → publications) |
| **Worldview updating** | Enables continuous updating of mental models with SoTA knowledge over long time horizons |

---

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required? |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Pre-selected study materials | Books, textbooks, courses, articles chosen during strategizing | Yes |
| Dissatisfaction list | Awareness of knowledge gaps that guide material selection | Yes |
| Dedicated time slot | Planned daily slot (minimum 25 minutes) | Yes |
| Workspace | Comfortable desk with large screen, not bed or smartphone | Yes |
| Prior knowledge base | Accumulated knowledge that enables cognitive resonance | No |

---

## Outputs (Work Products)

| Output | Link | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Educational notes | [PD.WP.003](../04-work-products/PD.WP.003-educational-notes.md) | Notes created during reading when cognitive resonance occurs |

---

## Roles Involved

| Role | Responsibility in This Method |
|------|------------------------------|
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Performs daily reading and note-taking |

---

## Related Methods

| Method | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| [PD.METHOD.004 Thinking in Writing](./PD.METHOD.004-thinking-in-writing.md) | Simultaneous — operates in tandem during reading |
| [PD.METHOD.008 Strategizing](./PD.METHOD.008-strategizing.md) | Precedes — determines what materials to read |

---

## Key Distinctions

| Distinction | Link | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| Invested time vs. Spent time | [D.016](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d016-invested-time-vs-spent-time) | Reading pre-selected materials is investment; browsing social media is spending |
| Slow reading vs. Speed reading | D.017 | Slow reading requires pauses for notes; speed reading optimizes throughput without processing |

---

## Constraints and Applicability

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Minimum duration** | 25 minutes daily; consistency matters more than volume |
| **Tandem requirement** | Must be performed together with Thinking in Writing; reading without notes is a different activity |
| **Material pre-selection** | Materials must be chosen in advance during strategizing, not selected spontaneously |
| **Workspace requirement** | Dual-screen setup recommended: one for reading, one for notes |

### When Applicable
- When studying new theory or domain knowledge
- When updating worldview with SoTA knowledge
- When dissatisfactions point to knowledge gaps

### When Not Applicable
- For entertainment reading (fiction for pleasure)
- When material is already well-known (no cognitive resonance expected)

---

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Reading without notes | Degrades into passive consumption; no creative pipeline input |
| Irregular practice | Loses cumulative effect; consistency matters more than volume |
| Reading in uncomfortable place | Bed, smartphone reduce cognitive capacity for note-taking |
| Speed reading new theory | Inappropriate for material requiring deep processing |
| Ignoring cognitive resonance | Missing the moment when new information clashes with existing models |
| Environment-driven selection | Reading what appears in feed rather than pre-selected materials |

---

## Tools Commonly Used

| Tool | How Used |
|------|----------|
| Computer with large screen | Primary reading device with space for parallel note-taking |
| Note-taking application | For capturing educational notes alongside reading |
| Dual-screen setup | One screen for text, one for notes — reduces attention switching cost |

---

## SoTA Status

**Status**: `current`

**Basis**: The practice of deliberate, note-accompanied reading is established in knowledge management literature. The specific formulation as daily planned practice with cognitive resonance emphasis draws from Aisystant methodology.

**Revision criterion**: Status would change if evidence shows that passive reading produces equivalent knowledge integration, or if AI-mediated reading eliminates the need for manual note-taking.
