# [PD.METHOD.004] Thinking in Writing

---

## Definition

**Thinking in Writing** is a method of creating thoughts through the act of writing, where the text is not a record of pre-formed ideas but the medium in which new ideas emerge. The method operates as a four-stage creative pipeline: fleeting notes → draft sorting → priority selection → publications (drafts for peers).

Thinking in writing is NOT:
- Journaling or diary-keeping (those record events, not generate thought)
- Free writing (thinking in writing requires focus on concepts and their connections)
- Professional writing for audience (that requires additional applied practices)
- Recording pre-formed thoughts (thoughts must emerge during writing)

---

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Neural network training** | Creates new neural pathways by connecting concepts through writing |
| **Thought materialization** | Externalizes thinking into inspectable, revisable artifacts |
| **Knowledge base building** | Produces personal knowledge base in exocortex (notes, drafts, publications) |
| **Complexity handling** | In difficult situations, writing decomposes problems into manageable elements |

---

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required? |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Fleeting notes | Spontaneous ideas captured during the day (smartphone, quick notes) | Yes |
| Educational notes | Notes from Systematic Slow Reading when cognitive resonance occurs | Yes |
| Vanishing notes | Raw material for sorting — original notes deleted after processing into drafts | No |
| Existing drafts | Previously accumulated drafts for further development | No |

---

## Outputs (Work Products)

| Output | Link | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Draft (заготовка) | [PD.WP.004](../04-work-products/PD.WP.004-draft.md) | Unfinished text written for self and peers, not for public audience |

---

## Roles Involved

| Role | Responsibility in This Method |
|------|------------------------------|
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Performs daily note-taking and weekly draft creation |

---

## Related Methods

| Method | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| [PD.METHOD.003 Systematic Slow Reading](./PD.METHOD.003-systematic-slow-reading.md) | Simultaneous — educational notes are created during reading |
| [PD.METHOD.008 Strategizing](./PD.METHOD.008-strategizing.md) | Produces inputs — strategizing products are created through thinking in writing |
| [PD.METHOD.005 Thinking by Speaking](./PD.METHOD.005-thinking-by-speaking.md) | Complementary — speaking can precede writing; both develop thinking |

---

## Key Distinctions

| Distinction | Link | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| Thinking in writing vs. Freewriting | [D.019](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d019-thinking-in-writing-vs-freewriting) | Thinking in writing focuses on concepts and SoTA theories; freewriting has no quality criterion |

---

## Four-Stage Pipeline

| Stage | Activity | Frequency | Output |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Note-taking | Daily | Fleeting + educational notes |
| 2 | Note sorting | ≥1x/week | Drafts (organized by projects, concepts, topics) |
| 3 | Priority selection | During strategizing | List of priority drafts for the period |
| 4 | Writing and sharing | ≥1x/week | Drafts shared with peers (skin in the game) |

Stages 5-7 (public articles, promotion, revision) are beyond thinking in writing and require additional applied practices.

---

## Constraints and Applicability

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Daily practice** | Must be performed every day; consistency over quality for beginners |
| **Publication requirement** | Drafts must be shared at minimum among peers — skin in the game |
| **No writing from scratch** | First publications only from accumulated notes, not from blank page |
| **Concept focus** | Writing must engage with concepts, principles, and their connections |

### When Applicable
- When processing new information (alongside reading)
- When facing complex problems requiring decomposition
- When building personal knowledge base
- When preparing strategizing materials

### When Not Applicable
- When the goal is professional-quality public writing (requires additional practices)
- When the goal is emotional expression without cognitive engagement

---

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Not taking daily notes | No input for the pipeline; neural network not trained |
| Expecting perfect first draft | Fear of publishing prevents practice; drafts are not articles |
| Writing from scratch | Bypassing note accumulation stage leads to burnout |
| Writing without concept focus | Produces opinion collection instead of knowledge base |
| Not sharing drafts | No skin in the game; hypotheses not tested; motivation drops |
| Confusing stages | Jumping from notes directly to public article skips essential stages |

---

## Tools Commonly Used

| Tool | How Used |
|------|----------|
| Smartphone | Capturing fleeting notes during the day |
| Note-taking app | Organizing notes, drafts, and publications |
| Exocortex (personal knowledge base) | Long-term storage of all pipeline products |

---

## SoTA Status

**Status**: `current`

**Basis**: The practice draws on Zettelkasten methodology (Luhmann), extended with the creative pipeline model and neural network training metaphor from Aisystant methodology. Writing as thinking medium is supported by cognitive science research on extended cognition.

**Revision criterion**: Status would change if evidence shows that thinking without external materialization produces equivalent knowledge integration, or if AI co-writing fully substitutes the neural pathway formation effect.
