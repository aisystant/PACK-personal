# [PD.METHOD.010] Daily Reflective Role-Product Review

---

## Definition

**Daily Reflective Role-Product Review** is an evening micro-practice: list (1) roles performed today, (2) external work products created, (3) internal work products created. Purpose: prevent productivity illusion, balance analytical/engineering work, build role awareness.

A Daily Reflective Review is NOT:
- A to-do list review (which checks tasks, not roles and products)
- Journaling (which captures emotions and narratives, not structured role/product data)
- Time accounting (which tracks time allocation, not role-product mapping)

---

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Productivity illusion prevention** | Reveals days with zero external work products |
| **Analytical/engineering balance** | Shows ratio of internal vs. external WPs |
| **Role awareness building** | Trains the habit of naming roles throughout the day |
| **Daily feedback loop** | Quick correction signal before the next day |

---

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required? |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Memory of the day | What was done today | Yes |
| Time budget data | From Time Accounting if available | No |

---

## Outputs (Work Products)

This method does not produce a formal work product. Its output is a brief evening list (3-5 minutes of reflection) that may be recorded in notes or exocortex. The primary value is the reflective act itself, not the artifact.

---

## Procedure

| Step | Action | Duration |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | List roles performed today (e.g., "engineer, learner, strategist") | 1 min |
| 2 | List external WPs created today (deliverables, artifacts for others) | 1 min |
| 3 | List internal WPs created today (plans, analyses for self) | 1 min |
| 4 | Check: is the external WP list empty? If yes, note the imbalance | 30 sec |
| 5 | Optional: note which role was unconscious (no clear method) | 30 sec |

**Total time**: 3-5 minutes

## Roles Involved

| Role | Responsibility in This Method |
|------|------------------------------|
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Performs the evening review |

## Related Methods

| Method | Relationship |
|--------|-------------|
| [PD.METHOD.001 Time Accounting](./PD.METHOD.001-time-accounting.md) | Complementary — time accounting tracks time; this method tracks roles and products |
| [PD.METHOD.008 Strategizing](./PD.METHOD.008-strategizing.md) | Upstream — strategizing determines which roles to prioritize |
| [PD.METHOD.009 Planning](./PD.METHOD.009-planning.md) | Upstream — planning distributes roles across the week |

## Key Distinctions

| Distinction | Link | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| Conscious Role Execution vs. Automatic Behavior | [D.076](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d076-conscious-role-execution-vs-automatic-behavior) | The review builds awareness of which mode was dominant |
| Analytical Work vs. Engineering Work | [D.077](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d077-analytical-work-vs-engineering-work-agents-daily-split) | The review reveals the balance between the two |

---

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Skipping the review | Without the evening check, productivity illusion goes undetected |
| Vague role naming | "I worked" instead of naming specific roles — defeats the purpose |
| Not tracking external WPs | Counting internal WPs as "products" — misses the key signal |

---

## Constraints and Applicability

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Daily practice** | Must be done every evening (including weekends — roles are played on weekends too) |
| **Brevity** | Maximum 5 minutes — not a journaling session |
| **Honesty** | The list must reflect actual roles and products, not aspirational ones |

### When Applicable
- Every day, regardless of how "productive" the day felt

### When Not Applicable
- Sick days or genuine rest days with no work attempted

## SoTA Status

**Status**: `current`

**Basis**: Derived from systems thinking role-method-product framework applied to daily reflective practice. Source: Guide 1-3, Section 3.5 (explicit recommendation to list analytical vs. engineering work daily).

**Revision criterion**: Status would change if a superior micro-reflection method for productivity illusion detection is established.
